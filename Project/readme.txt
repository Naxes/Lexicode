Q.  What's the deal with the CSS?
A.  We are using SCSS (pronounced SASS). It provides advanced features not normally found in CSS. The resulting 
output is regular CSS in a file called "output.css". This is not the file to edit when adding additional CSS.
If you have any questions about this consult me or, alternatively, look here: http://sass-lang.com
    
Q.  Where do the icons come from?
A.  Firstly, the icons on the website are not bootstrap glyphicons. In Bootstrap 4, those have been done away
with. Instead we are using Font Awesome. Their website lists all icons available and how to use them.
    
Q.  How is the code on the about page done?
A.  Using PrismJS. PrismJS is a syntax highlighter that allows you to correctly indicate the langauge of a 
snippet of code within <pre> and nested <code> tags, respectively.
